# foundation-sass-stylus-diff

This project shows the differences between the original [foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation) based on SASS, and one that I have converted into Stylus [here](https://github.com/blai/foundation)

### run
```
grunt
```
This builds the scss version of app.css into `dist/scss/app.css`, and stylus version of app.css into `dist/stylus/app.css`. It also starts a local server so you can open http://localhost:3000 to see the stylus version and open http://localhost:3000/scss.html to se the scss version.

Filed css.diff contains the output generated by running `git diff dist/stylus/app.css dist/scss/app.css > css.diff`
